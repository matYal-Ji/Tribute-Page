                <p>
                  Itachi was a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. 
                  He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan.

                    <p> 
                        His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to <span>seek peace at any cost</span>. 
                        Learning that his clan began planning a <span>coup d'état</span> to take control of Konoha after being unjustly 
                        accused of attacking the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi feared a war would break and became a double agent to 
                        provide Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions.

                    <p> 
                        Thus over time, Itachi began to distance himself from his clan as some believed he murdered his best friend 
                        Shisui Uchiha to gain a Mangekyo Sharingan. But in reality, as he possesses an ability to subliminally manipulate 
                        others, Shisui was mortally wounded by Danzo and entrusted Itachi with his remaining eye to achieve peace.

                        Eventually, with Danzo forcing him with the promise of sparing his younger brother, Itachi slaughters his entire 
                        clan with the exception of Sasuke. After creating a facade that he murdered their family in cold blood to give 
                        Sasuke the mindset to become strong enough to kill him once old enough, Itachi leaves the village with Konoha's 
                        Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi promising to do what he can to look after Sasuke. Itachi also keeps Danzo from breaking 
                        his word by threatening to reveal the truth of the incident if he ever harms Sasuke.

                        Soon after, deciding to protect his village from the shadows, Itachi joined the Akatsuki to ensure they do not endanger 
                        Konoha. In the process, Itachi became good friends with his partner Kisame Hoshigaki who expresses concern for Itachi's 
                        well-being. While beginning to suffer blindness due to overuse of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi began to suffer an 
                        illness which he tries to keep at bay long enough for Sasuke to kill him.

                        Sasuke ultimately tracks him down and they have their final battle, during which he uses his Mangekyo Sharingan to push 
                        Sasuke to his limits. In doing so, Orochimaru is drawn out from Sasuke's body (Orochimaru, a Sanin, sought Sasuke's body 
                        because of his Sharingan), and Itachi seals him away with his Susanoo before finally dying from his disease.
