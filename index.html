                  Itachi was a member of the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Uchiha_Clan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uchiha Clan</a> 
                  from the village of <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Konohagakure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Konohagakure</a>
                   and the elder brother of <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sasuke Uchiha</a>. 
                  He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan.

                    <p> 
                        His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to <span>seek peace at any cost</span>. 
                        Learning that his clan began planning a <span>coup d'état</span> to take control of Konoha after being unjustly

                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nine Tails</a>, Itachi feared a war would break and became a double agent 
                        to provide Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions.

                    <p> 
                        Thus over time, Itachi began to distance himself from his clan as some believed he murdered his best friend 
                        <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shisui_Uchiha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shisui Uchiha</a> 
                        to gain a Mangekyo Sharingan. But in reality, as he possesses an ability to subliminally manipulate 
                        others, Shisui was mortally wounded by Danzo and entrusted Itachi with his remaining eye to achieve peace.

                        Eventually, with Danzo forcing him with the promise of sparing his younger brother, Itachi slaughters his entire 
                        clan with the exception of Sasuke. After creating a facade that he murdered their family in cold blood to give 
                        Sasuke the mindset to become strong enough to kill him once old enough, Itachi leaves the village with Konoha's
